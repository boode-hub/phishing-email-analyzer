// Scoring Module
// Composite risk score calculation
//
// Two rules this module now holds to:
//
// 1. Each sub-score is capped BEFORE it is weighted. Previously the weighted
//    total used the uncapped IOC score, so twenty newsletter shortener links
//    (20 x 8 = 160, weighted to 48) pushed a message with SPF, DKIM and DMARC
//    all passing into "Suspicious". Volume of low-severity indicators must not
//    substitute for severity.
// 2. Every point added emits a reason. If the tool cannot say why a message
//    scored what it scored, the score is not usable by an analyst.
